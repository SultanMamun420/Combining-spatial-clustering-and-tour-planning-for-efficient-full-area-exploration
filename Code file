# Combining Spatial Clustering and Tour Planning for Efficient Full Area Exploration

This repository will provide C++ code for autonomous exploration in both simulation and real-world settings on a mobile robot. This is the reference implementation for the paper which has been submitted for review.

## How to compile

- edit the "def.h"
- edit the file "src/dsvplanner/dsvplanner\include/dsvplanner/def.h"
- enable "#define NEW_METHOD" for running our method
- disable "#define NEW_METHOD" for running the original DSVP method
- we suggest set CLUSTERING_EPSILON = 2 for narrow environments and set CLUSTERING_EPSILON = 3 for spatious environments

```
cd dsv_planner
cd exploration
catkin_make
```

## How to run
- launch the simulated environment
- launch the simulated environment from [autonomous_exploration_development_environment](https://github.com/HongbiaoZ/autonomous_exploration_development_environment)
```
roslaunch vehicle_simulator system_indoor.launch
